# React + Vite

This is a react app I created by following along with this youtube video. It was created to give me a better understanding of the core basics of react, such as state, components, hooks and prompts. 
In addition I use appwrite as a backend and to host a simple database.
This app allows you to search for millions of movies using the TMDB API has an efficient searching mechanism that creates the trending movies section and uses debouncing to create a sophisticated searching experience.




This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
